# Amazon reviews sentiment analysis 

The aim of this project is to analyse a range of Amazon reviews and find the most common word associated with a particular keyword and sentiment. I developed a Python based Hadoop Map/Reduce solution that, in a single run, find all reviews that contain the set of key words and find the most common word that occurs for that keyword and associated sentiment across all reviews.  

Each review is on a single line and comprises of a title, a review, and a sentiment rating where 1 is a negative sentiment and 2 is a positive sentiment. The input data is contained in reviews.txt file and the keywords are provided in keywords.txt file.
